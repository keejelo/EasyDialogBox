### Current version: 1.735.68
  Latest updated version of the file "easydlg.js" is kept here in this folder.
  Previous versions of the file are moved into the "history" folder.

# Medium optimized version:
  The file "easydlg.med.js" is created from "easydlg.js" by first setting its inside variable: DEBUG = false
  and then minified with https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
  using the "whitespace only" optimization, which just removes comments, whitespace and linebreaks.
  * Should work in both old and modern browsers since all code is still intact, including legacy code.
  * Only basic features supported in IE8 (no errors during emulated testing, features just ignored).

# Minified version, maximum optimization:
  The file "easydlg.min.js" is created from "easydlg.js" by first setting its inside variable: DEBUG = false
  and then minified with https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
  using the "simple" optimization.
  * Intended for browsers that support the ECMAScript 5 standard (released in 2009), all modern browsers.
  * Not supported by IE8 and old legacy browsers.
