<b>Changes from version 1.722 and above:</b>

The "classflags" below has had their names changed due to naming ambiguity causing bugs:

"<b>dlg-no-drag</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-drag</b>"

"<b>dlg-no-btns</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-btns</b>"

"<b>dlg-no-overlay</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-overlay</b>"

"<b>dlg-no-footer</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-footer</b>"


I'm deeply sorry for the problems that this may cause / have caused!
