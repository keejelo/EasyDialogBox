# EasyDialogBox

Easy to use HTML-CSS-Javascript dialog box, messagebox, alert, confirm, prompt, with optional icons.

Lightweight. Responsive. Plain vanilla Javascript, no libraries.

Supported by modern browsers using standard HTML, CSS and Javascript.  
(ECMAScript 5 and above. Though trying to support old legacy browsers as much as possible.)

# Important flagname changes:

The "classflags" below has had their names changed due to name ambiguity: 

"<b>dlg-no-drag</b>" is now called "dlg-disable-drag"

"dlg-no-btns" is now called "dlg-disable-btns"

"dlg-no-overlay" is now called "dlg-disable-overlay"

"dlg-no-footer" is now called "dlg-disable-footer"


I'm deeply sorry for the problems that this may have caused!
