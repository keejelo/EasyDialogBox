# EasyDialogBox

Easy to use HTML-CSS-Javascript dialog box, messagebox, alert, confirm, prompt, with optional icons.

Lightweight. Responsive. Plain vanilla Javascript, no libraries.

Supported by modern browsers using standard HTML, CSS and Javascript.  
(Trying to use crossbrowser-code, and to support old legacy browsers and as much as possible.)

## Important flagname changes
<b>From version 1.722 and above:</b>

The "classflags" below has had their names changed due to naming ambiguity causing bugs:

"<b>dlg-no-drag</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-drag</b>"

"<b>dlg-no-btns</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-btns</b>"

"<b>dlg-no-overlay</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-overlay</b>"

"<b>dlg-no-footer</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-footer</b>"


I'm deeply sorry for the problems that this may cause / have caused!
