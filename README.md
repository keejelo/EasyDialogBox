Documentation and live examples:

<br />

Below shows a very basic and simple example of how to create and show a dialogbox:
<pre>let myBox = EasyDialogBox.create('myId', 'dlg', 'My title', '&lt;p&gt;Hello there!&lt;/p&gt;');
myBox.show();</pre>

Produces this:

<img src="example.png" alt="example.png" />
<i>This is the default style, but it can of course be customized as you wish with optional flags, and even further with css.</i>
<br /><br />

## Important changes
- <b>Version 1.735 and above:</b><br />
  Removed parameter <code>bKeepAlive</code> from function: <code>EasyDialogBox.create(...);</code>
  <br />
  Syntax is now:<br />
  <code>EasyDialogBox.create(id, strBoxTypeClass, strTitle, strMessage, fnCallback, x, y, w, h);</code>
  
  <br />
  
- <b>Version 1.722 and above:</b><br />
  The "classflags" below has had their names changed due to naming ambiguity causing bugs:
  - "<b>dlg-no-drag</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-drag</b>"
  - "<b>dlg-no-btns</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-btns</b>"
  - "<b>dlg-no-overlay</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-overlay</b>"
  - "<b>dlg-no-footer</b>" is now called "<b>dlg-disable-footer</b>"

<br />

## Motivation
I started this when I needed a multipurpose dialogbox for my own projects. Not wanting to be dependant on any libraries, I wrote this dialogbox module using only plain Javascript. If anyone else finds this useful that's great.<br /><br />
Although dialogboxes has got a "bad rap" in the web-world, I still think they have their use when used correctly and in the right settings.
